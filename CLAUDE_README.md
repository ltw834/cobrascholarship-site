Always read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md first before making changes.
When updating code:
1) Update files under _staging/
2) Deploy via Git push (GitHub Actions) OR VS Code SFTP for hotfixes
3) Keep backups/ CSV private (server path: /public_html/backups/applications.csv)
If you change form fields, also update _staging/apply-save.php and PROJECT_CONTEXT.md.
